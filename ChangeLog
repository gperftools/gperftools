Fri Apr 13 14:50:51 2007  Google Inc. <opensource@google.com>

	* google-perftools: version 0.90 release
	* (As the version-number jump hints, this is a major new release:
	  almost every piece of functionality was rewritten.  I can't do
	  justice to all the changes, but will concentrate on highlights.)
	*** USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
	* Ability to "release" unused memory added to tcmalloc
	* Exposed more tweaking knobs via environment variables (see docs)
	* pprof tries harder to map addresses to functions
	* tcmalloc_minimal compiles and runs on FreeBSD 6.0 and Solaris 10
	*** INTERNAL CHANGES:
	* Much better 64-bit support
	* Better multiple-processor support (e.g. multicore contention tweaks)
	* Support for recent kernel ABI changes (e.g. new arg to mremap)
	* Addition of spinlocks to tcmalloc to reduce contention cost
	* Speed up tcmalloc by using __thread on systems that support TLS
	* Total redesign of heap-checker to improve liveness checking
	* More portable stack-frame analysis -- no more hard-coded constants!
	* Disentangled heap-profiler code and heap-checker code
	* Several new unittests to test, e.g., thread-contention costs
	* Lots of small (but important!) bug fixes: e.g., fixing GetPC on amd64
	*** KNOWN PROBLEMS:
	* CPU-profiling may crash on x86_64 (64-bit) systems.  See the README
	* Profiling/heap-checking may deadlock on x86_64 systems.  See README
