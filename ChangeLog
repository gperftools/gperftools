	* google-perftools: initial release:
	  The google-perftools package contains some utilities to improve
	  and analyze the performance of C++ programs.  This includes an
	  optimized thread-caching malloc() and cpu and heap profiling
	  utilities.

	* google-perftools: version 0.2 release
	* Use mmap2() instead of mmap(), to map more memory (menage)
	* Do correct pthread-local checking in heap-checker! (maxim)
	* Avoid overflow on 64-bit machines in pprof (sanjay)
	* Add a few more GetPC() functions, including for AMD (csilvers)
	* Better method for overriding pthread functions (menage)
	* (Hacky) fix to avoid overwriting profile files after fork() (csilvers)
	* Crashing bugfix involving dumping heaps on small-stack threads (tudor)
	* Allow library versions with letters at the end (csilvers)
	* Config fixes for systems that don't define PATH_MAX (csilvers)
	* Confix fixes so we no longer need config.h after install (csilvers)

	* Better error reporting when we can't access /proc/maps (etune)
	* Get rid of the libc-preallocate code (which could crash on some
	  systems); no longer needed with local-threads fix (csilvers)

	* google-perftools: version 0.3 release
	* Add missing errno include for one of the unittests (csilvers)
	* Reduce tcmalloc startup memory from 5M to 256K (sanjay)
	* Add support for mallopt() and mallinfo (sanjay)

	* google-perftools: version 0.4 release
	* Decrease fragmentation in tcmalloc (lefevere)
	* Support for ARM in some of the thread-specific code (markus)
	* Turn off heap-checker for statically-linked binaries, which
	  cause error leak reports now (etune)

	  ignore non-aligned stackframe pointers (markus, menage)
	* 64-bit cleanup, especially for spinlock code (etune) and mmap (sanjay)
	* Better support for finding threads in linux (markus)
	* tcmalloc now tracks those stack traces that allocate memory (sanjay)
	* Work around a weird setspecific problem (sanjay)
	* Fix tcmalloc overflow problems when an alloc is close to 2G/4G (sanjay)

	* google-perftools: version 0.5 release
	* Add va_start/va_end calls around vsnprintf() (csilvers)
	* Write our own __syscall_return(), since it's not defined
	  consistently on all 64-bit linux distros (markus)

Fri Jan 27 14:04:27 2006  Google Inc. <opensource@google.com>

	* google-perftools: version 0.6 release
	* More sophisticated stacktrace usage, possibly using libunwind (aruns)
	* Update pprof to handle 64-bit profiles (dehnert)

	* New PC-detection routine for ibook powerpc (asbestoshead)
	* Vastly improved tcmalloc unittest (csilvers)

	* Major rewrite of thread introspection for new kernels (markus)
	* Major rewrite of heap-checker to use new thread tools (maxim)
	* Add proper support for following data in thread registers (maxim)
	* Syscall support for older kernels, including _syscall6 (markus)
	* Support PIC mode (markus, mbland, iant)
