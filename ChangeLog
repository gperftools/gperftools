	* google-perftools: version 0.90 release
	* (As the version-number jump hints, this is a major new release:
	  almost every piece of functionality was rewritten.  I can't do

	* Addition of spinlocks to tcmalloc to reduce contention cost
	* Speed up tcmalloc by using __thread on systems that support TLS

	* Lots of small (but important!) bug fixes: e.g., fixing GetPC on amd64
	*** KNOWN PROBLEMS:
	* CPU-profiling may crash on x86_64 (64-bit) systems.  See the README
	* Profiling/heap-checking may deadlock on x86_64 systems.  See README
