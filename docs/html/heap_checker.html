<h1>Automatic Leaks Checking Support</h1>

This document describes how to check the heap usage of a C++
program.  This facility can be useful for automatically detecting
memory leaks.

<h2>Linking in the Heap Checker</h2>

<p>
You can heap-check any program that has the tcmalloc library linked
in.  No recompilation is necessary to use the heap checker.
</p>

<p>
In order to catch all heap leaks, tcmalloc must be linked <i>last</i> into
your executable.  The heap checker may mischaracterize some memory
accesses in libraries listed after it on the link line.  For instance,
it may report these libraries as leaking memory when they're not.
(See the source code for more details.)
</p>

<p>
It's safe to link in tcmalloc even if you don't expect to
heap-check your program.  Your programs will not run any slower
as long as you don't use any of the heap-checker features.
</p>

<p>
You can run the heap checker on applications you didn't compile
yourself, by using LD_PRELOAD:
</p>
<pre>   $ LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/libtcmalloc.so" HEAPCHECK=normal <binary>
</binary></pre>
<p>
We don't necessarily recommend this mode of usage.
</p>

<h2>Turning On Heap Checking</h2>

<p>There are two alternatives to actually turn on heap checking for a
given run of an executable.</p>

<ul>
<li> For whole-program heap-checking, define the environment variable
     HEAPCHECK to the type of heap
     checking you want: normal, strict, or draconian.  For instance,
     to heap-check <code>/bin/ls</code>:
     <pre>      $ HEAPCHECK=normal /bin/ls
      % setenv HEAPCHECK normal; /bin/ls   # csh
     </pre>
     OR

</li><li> For partial-code heap-checking, you need to modify your code.
     For each piece of code you want heap-checked, bracket the code
     by creating a <code>HeapLeakChecker</code> object
     (which takes a descriptive label as an argument), and calling
     <code>check.NoLeaks()</code> at the end of the code you want
     checked.  This will verify no more memory is allocated at the
     end of the code segment than was allocated in the beginning.  To
     actually turn on the heap-checking, set the environment variable
     HEAPCHECK to <code>local</code>.


<p>
Here is an example of the second usage.  The following code will
die if <code>Foo()</code> leaks any memory
(i.e. it allocates memory that is not freed by the time it returns):
</p>
<pre>    HeapProfileLeakChecker checker("foo");
    Foo();
    assert(checker.NoLeaks());
</pre>

<p>
When the <code>checker</code> object is allocated, it creates
one heap profile.  When <code>checker.NoLeaks()</code> is invoked,
it creates another heap profile and compares it to the previously
created profile.  If the new profile indicates memory growth
(or any memory allocation change if one
uses <code>checker.SameHeap()</code> instead), <code>NoLeaks()</code>
will return false and the program will abort.  An error message will
also be printed out saying how <code>pprof</code> command can be run
to get a detailed analysis of the actual leaks.
</p>

<p>
See the comments for <code>HeapProfileLeakChecker</code> class in
<code>heap-checker.h</code> and the code in
<code>heap-checker_unittest.cc</code> for more information and
examples.  (TODO: document it all here instead!)
</p>

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: pthreads handling is currently incomplete.
Heap leak checks will fail with bogus leaks if there are pthreads live
at construction or leak checking time.  One solution, for global
heap-checking, is to make sure all threads but the main thread have
exited at program-end time.  We hope (as of March 2005) to have a fix
soon.
</p>

<h2>Disabling Heap-checking of Known Leaks</h2>

<p>
Sometimes your code has leaks that you know about and are willing to
accept.  You would like the heap checker to ignore them when checking
your program.  You can do this by bracketing the code in question with
an appropriate heap-checking object:
</p>
<pre>   #include <google>
   ...
   void *mark = HeapLeakChecker::GetDisableChecksStart();
   &lt;leaky code&gt;
   HeapLeakChecker::DisableChecksToHereFrom(mark);
</google></pre>

<p>
Some libc routines allocate memory, and may need to be 'disabled' in
this way.  As time goes on, we hope to encode proper handling of
these routines into the heap-checker library code, so applications
needn't worry about them, but that process is not yet complete.
