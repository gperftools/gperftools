= TCMalloc : Thread-Caching Malloc

:reproducible:

== [#motivation]#Motivation#

+[alk: Update from Dec 2024]+ Wondering how to update this document
from beginning of 2000-x I am choosing to keep this original
motivation writeup just below. Do keep in mind that referenced glibc
versions are now long obsolete. And amount of time per malloc call is
far from correct anymore. And the description is for 32-bit
computers. Still, I am choosing to keep this text intact, to help
people see where tcmalloc came from. "I" below refers to original
author: Sanjay. See at the end of this paragraph for some commentary
relevant for today.

'''''

TCMalloc is faster than the glibc 2.3 malloc (available as a separate
library called ptmalloc2) and other mallocs that I have tested.
ptmalloc2 takes approximately 300 nanoseconds to execute a malloc/free
pair on a 2.8 GHz P4 (for small objects). The TCMalloc implementation
takes approximately 50 nanoseconds for the same operation pair. Speed is
important for a malloc implementation because if malloc is not fast
enough, application writers are inclined to write their own custom free
lists on top of malloc. This can lead to extra complexity, and more
memory usage unless the application writer is very careful to
appropriately size the free lists and scavenge idle objects out of the
free list.

TCMalloc also reduces lock contention for multi-threaded programs. For
small objects, there is virtually zero contention. For large objects,
TCMalloc tries to use fine grained and efficient spinlocks. ptmalloc2
also reduces lock contention by using per-thread arenas but there is a
big problem with ptmalloc2's use of per-thread arenas. In ptmalloc2
memory can never move from one arena to another. This can lead to huge
amounts of wasted space. For example, in one Google application, the
first phase would allocate approximately 300MB of memory for its URL
canonicalization data structures. When the first phase finished, a
second phase would be started in the same address space. If this second
phase was assigned a different arena than the one used by the first
phase, this phase would not reuse any of the memory left after the first
phase and would add another 300MB to the address space. Similar memory
blowup problems were also noticed in other applications.

Another benefit of TCMalloc is space-efficient representation of small
objects. For example, N 8-byte objects can be allocated while using
space approximately `+8N * 1.01+` bytes. I.e., a one-percent space
overhead. ptmalloc2 uses a four-byte header for each object and (I
think) rounds up the size to a multiple of 8 bytes and ends up using
`+16N+` bytes.

'''''

+[alk: Update from Dec 2024]+ tcmalloc (now gperftools) has evolved a
lot over last 20-ish years. Back then it was one of the first
production-grade malloc that used per-thread caching. This days
per-thread (or even per-cpu) caching is widespread. Typical C++
programs tend to allocate and free memory somewhat frequently and
those small allocations are generally kept fast and avoid any locks
(in most cases). Most of gperftools evolution was on getting those
common cases even cheaper. Others improved too. glibc, while still
being somewhat slower than gperftools, is a lot faster than it was and
also avoids locks in many of those common case allocations.

gperftools on modern systems with efficient "native" thread-local
storage access (i.e. GNU/Linux, most BSDs, even Windows, but, notably,
not OSX) takes just a couple dozen cheap instructions for allocation
or deallocation, which is better than most competition. We're talking
in the ballpark of just a couple nanoseconds per operation on modern
fast out-of-order CPUs in this fast-path case (all caches are hot
etc). I.e. compare to mid-tens of nanos per malloc/free pair 20 years
ago (!)

Also, the reader should be aware that another descendant of the
original tcmalloc is now available at
https://github.com/google/tcmalloc (I call it "abseil tcmalloc" due to
it's hard dependency on abseil). Its main feature is efficient per-cpu
caches (but it needs RSEQ support from fairly recent Linux kernels).

Another direction of evolution, particularly at Google, was increasing
focus on helping diagnose or prevent production problems related to
dynamic memory allocation. So there is debug version of tcmalloc with
some relatively lightweight checking against common bugs (like
double-free). So there is heap sampling that has low enough overhead
to be always enabled. There are relatively comprehensive statistics
available and more. "abseil tcmalloc" is doing even better than
gperftools in this regard.

== [#Usage]#Usage#

To use TCMalloc, just link TCMalloc into your application via the
"-ltcmalloc" linker flag.

You can use TCMalloc in applications you didn't compile yourself, by
using LD_PRELOAD:

....
   % LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/libtcmalloc.so"
....

TCMalloc includes a link:heapprofile.adoc[heap profiler] as well.

If you'd rather link in a version of TCMalloc that does not include
the heap profiler (perhaps to reduce binary size for a static binary),
you can link in `+libtcmalloc_minimal+` instead.

== [#Overview]#Overview#

TCMalloc assigns each thread a thread-local cache. Small allocations are
satisfied from the thread-local cache. Objects are moved from central
data structures into a thread-local cache as needed, and periodic
garbage collections are used to migrate memory back from a thread-local
cache into the central data structures.

image:overview.gif[overview]

TCMalloc treats objects with size +<=+ 256K ("small" objects) differently
from larger objects. Large objects are allocated directly from the
central heap using a page-level allocator (a page is a 8K aligned region
of memory). I.e., a large object is always page-aligned and occupies an
integral number of pages.

A run of pages can be carved up into a sequence of small objects, each
equally sized. For example a run of one page (4K) can be carved up into
32 objects of size 128 bytes each.

== [#Small_Object_Allocation]#Small Object Allocation#

Each small object size maps to one of approximately 88 allocatable
size-classes. For example, all allocations in the range 961 to 1024
bytes are rounded up to 1024. The size-classes are spaced so that small
sizes are separated by 8 bytes, larger sizes by 16 bytes, even larger
sizes by 32 bytes, and so forth. The maximal spacing is controlled so
that not too much space is wasted when an allocation request falls just
past the end of a size class and has to be rounded up to the next class.

A thread cache contains a singly linked list of free objects per
size-class.

image:threadheap.gif[threadheap]

When allocating a small object: (1) We map its size to the corresponding
size-class. (2) Look in the corresponding free list in the thread cache
for the current thread. (3) If the free list is not empty, we remove the
first object from the list and return it. When following this fast path,
TCMalloc acquires no locks at all.

If the free list is empty: (1) We fetch a bunch of objects from a
central free list for this size-class (the central free list is shared
by all threads). (2) Place them in the thread-local free list. (3)
Return one of the newly fetched objects to the applications.

If the central free list is also empty: (1) We allocate a run of pages
from the central page allocator. (2) Split the run into a set of objects
of this size-class. (3) Place the new objects on the central free list.
(4) As before, move some of these objects to the thread-local free list.

=== [#Sizing_Thread_Cache_Free_Lists]#Sizing Thread Cache Free Lists#

It is important to size the thread cache free lists correctly. If the
free list is too small, we'll need to go to the central free list too
often. If the free list is too big, we'll waste memory as objects sit
idle in the free list.

Note that the thread caches are just as important for deallocation as
they are for allocation. Without a cache, each deallocation would
require moving the memory to the central free list. Also, some threads
have asymmetric alloc/free behavior (e.g. producer and consumer
threads), so sizing the free list correctly gets trickier.

To size the free lists appropriately, we use a slow-start algorithm to
determine the maximum length of each individual free list. As the free
list is used more frequently, its maximum length grows. However, if a
free list is used more for deallocation than allocation, its maximum
length will grow only up to a point where the whole list can be
efficiently moved to the central free list at once.

The pseudo-code below illustrates this slow-start algorithm. Note that
`+num_objects_to_move+` is specific to each size class. By moving a list
of objects with a well-known length, the central cache can efficiently
pass these lists between thread caches. If a thread cache wants fewer
than `+num_objects_to_move+`, the operation on the central free list has
linear time complexity. The downside of always using
`+num_objects_to_move+` as the number of objects to transfer to and from
the central cache is that it wastes memory in threads that don't need
all of those objects.

....
Start each freelist max_length at 1.

Allocation
  if freelist empty {
    fetch min(max_length, num_objects_to_move) from central list;
    if max_length < num_objects_to_move {  // slow-start
      max_length++;
    } else {
      max_length += num_objects_to_move;
    }
  }

Deallocation
  if length > max_length {
    // Don't try to release num_objects_to_move if we don't have that many.
    release min(max_length, num_objects_to_move) objects to central list
    if max_length < num_objects_to_move {
      // Slow-start up to num_objects_to_move.
      max_length++;
    } else if max_length > num_objects_to_move {
      // If we consistently go over max_length, shrink max_length.
      overages++;
      if overages > kMaxOverages {
        max_length -= num_objects_to_move;
        overages = 0;
      }
    }
  }
....

See also the section on link:#Garbage_Collection[Garbage Collection] to
see how it affects the `+max_length+`.

== [#Medium_Object_Allocation]#Medium Object Allocation#

A medium object size (256K ≤ size ≤ 1MB) is rounded up to a page size
(8K) and is handled by a central page heap. The central page heap
includes an array of 128 free lists. The `k`-th entry is a free list of
runs that consist of `k + 1` pages:

image:pageheap.gif[pageheap]

An allocation for `k` pages is satisfied by looking in the `k`-th
free list. If that free list is empty, we look in the next free list,
and so forth. If no medium-object free list can satisfy the allocation,
the allocation is treated as a large object.

== [#Large_Object_Allocation]#Large Object Allocation#

Allocations of 1MB or more are considered large allocations. Spans of
free memory which can satisfy these allocations are tracked in a
red-black tree sorted by size. Allocations follow the _best-fit_
algorithm: the tree is searched to find the smallest span of free space
which is larger than the requested allocation. The allocation is carved
out of that span, and the remaining space is reinserted either into the
large object tree or possibly into one of the smaller free-lists as
appropriate. If no span of free memory is located that can fit the
requested allocation, we fetch memory from the system (using `+sbrk+`,
or `+mmap+`).

If an allocation for `+k+` pages is satisfied by a run of pages of
length > `+k+`, the remainder of the run is re-inserted back into the
appropriate free list in the page heap.

== [#Spans]#Spans#

The heap managed by TCMalloc consists of a set of pages. A run of
contiguous pages is represented by a `+Span+` object. A span can either
be _allocated_, or _free_. If free, the span is one of the entries in a
page heap linked-list. If allocated, it is either a large object that
has been handed off to the application, or a run of pages that have been
split up into a sequence of small objects. If split into small objects,
the size-class of the objects is recorded in the span.

A central array indexed by page number can be used to find the span to
which a page belongs. For example, span _a_ below occupies 2 pages, span
_b_ occupies 1 page, span _c_ occupies 5 pages and span _d_ occupies 3
pages.

image:spanmap.gif[spanmap]

In a 32-bit address space, the central array is represented by a a
2-level radix tree where the root contains 32 entries and each leaf
contains 2^14 entries (a 32-bit address space has 2^19 8K pages, and the
first level of tree divides the 2^19 pages by 2^5). This leads to a
starting memory usage of 64KB of space (2^14*4 bytes) for the central
array, which seems acceptable.

On 64-bit machines, we use a 3-level radix tree. Note that, many
common 64-bit machines have limits on actual address space size. So on
x86 we use 48 bits of address and handle it by slightly-faster 2-level
radix tree.

== [#Deallocation]#Deallocation#

When an object is deallocated, we compute its page number and look it
up in the central array to find the corresponding span object. The
span tells us whether or not the object is small, and its size-class
if it is small. If the object is small, we insert it into the
appropriate free list in the current thread's thread cache. If the
thread cache now exceeds it's max_size_ amount, we run a garbage
collector that moves unused objects from the thread cache into central
free lists.

If the object is large, the span tells us the range of pages covered by
the object. Suppose this range is `+[p,q]+`. We also lookup the spans
for pages `+p-1+` and `+q+1+`. If either of these neighboring spans are
free, we coalesce them with the `+[p,q]+` span. The resulting span is
inserted into the appropriate free list in the page heap.

== Central Free Lists for Small Objects

As mentioned before, we keep a central free list for each size-class.
Each central free list is organized as a two-level data structure: a set
of spans, and a linked list of free objects per span.

An object is allocated from a central free list by removing the first
entry from the linked list of some span. (If all spans have empty linked
lists, a suitably sized span is first allocated from the central page
heap.)

An object is returned to a central free list by adding it to the linked
list of its containing span. If the linked list length now equals the
total number of small objects in the span, this span is now completely
free and is returned to the page heap.

== [#Garbage_Collection]#Garbage Collection of Thread Caches#

Garbage collecting objects from a thread cache keeps the size of the
cache under control and returns unused objects to the central free
lists. Some threads need large caches to perform well while others can
get by with little or no cache at all. When a thread cache goes over its
`+max_size+`, garbage collection kicks in and then the thread competes
with the other threads for a larger cache.

Garbage collection is run only during a deallocation. We walk over all
free lists in the cache and move some number of objects from the free
list to the corresponding central list.

The number of objects to be moved from a free list is determined using a
per-list low-water-mark `+L+`. `+L+` records the minimum length of the
list since the last garbage collection. Note that we could have
shortened the list by `+L+` objects at the last garbage collection
without requiring any extra accesses to the central list. We use this
past history as a predictor of future accesses and move `+L/2+` objects
from the thread cache free list to the corresponding central free list.
This algorithm has the nice property that if a thread stops using a
particular size, all objects of that size will quickly move from the
thread cache to the central free list where they can be used by other
threads.

If a thread consistently deallocates more objects of a certain size than
it allocates, this `+L/2+` behavior will cause at least `+L/2+` objects
to always sit in the free list. To avoid wasting memory this way, we
shrink the maximum length of the freelist to converge on
`+num_objects_to_move+` (see also
link:#Sizing_Thread_Cache_Free_Lists[Sizing Thread Cache Free Lists]).

....
Garbage Collection
  if (L != 0 && max_length > num_objects_to_move) {
    max_length = max(max_length - num_objects_to_move, num_objects_to_move)
  }
....

The fact that the thread cache went over its `+max_size+` is an
indication that the thread would benefit from a larger cache. Simply
increasing `+max_size+` would use an inordinate amount of memory in
programs that have lots of active threads. Developers can bound the
memory used with the parameter
`TCMALLOC_MAX_TOTAL_THREAD_CACHE_BYTES`.

Each thread cache starts with a small `+max_size+` (e.g. 64KB) so that
idle threads won't pre-allocate memory they don't need. Each time the
cache runs a garbage collection, it will also try to grow its
`+max_size+`. If the sum of the thread cache sizes is less than
`TCMALLOC_MAX_TOTAL_THREAD_CACHE_BYTES`, `+max_size+` grows easily. If
not, thread cache 1 will try to steal from thread cache 2 (picked
round-robin) by decreasing thread cache 2's `+max_size+`. In this way,
threads that are more active will steal memory from other threads more
often than they are have memory stolen from themselves. Mostly idle
threads end up with small caches and active threads end up with big
caches. Note that this stealing can cause the sum of the thread cache
sizes to be greater than `TCMALLOC_MAX_TOTAL_THREAD_CACHE_BYTES` until
thread cache 2 deallocates some memory to trigger a garbage
collection.

== [#performance]#Performance Notes#

gperftools' area of relative strength is cases where per-thread caches
are effective. This is typically exercised by fairly typical C++ codes
that allocate relatively often and where object lifetimes tend to be
small-ish.

Both "abseil tcmalloc" and gperftools continue to have un-sharded
central free lists and page heaps. Which means that misses to caches
tend to be not so scalable compared to some competition.

This means that in some cases you may want to tweak thread caches
higher. Also if your workload has many threads that tend to be idle
for longer durations, consider using
`MallocExtension::MarkThread{Idle,Busy}`.

== [#runtime]#Modifying Runtime Behavior#

You can more finely control the behavior of the tcmalloc via environment
variables.

Generally useful flags:

[cols=",,",]
|===

|`TCMALLOC_SAMPLE_PARAMETER` |default: 0 |The approximate gap between
sampling actions. That is, we take one sample approximately once every
`tcmalloc_sample_parmeter` bytes of allocation. This sampled heap
information is available via `MallocExtension::GetHeapSample()` or
`MallocExtension::ReadStackTraces()`. A reasonable value is 524288.

|`TCMALLOC_RELEASE_RATE` |default: 1.0 |Rate at which we release
unused memory to the system, via `+madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)+`, on systems
that support it. Zero means we never release memory back to the system.
Increase this flag to return memory faster; decrease it to return memory
slower. Reasonable rates are in the range [0,10].

|`TCMALLOC_LARGE_ALLOC_REPORT_THRESHOLD` |default: 1073741824
|Allocations larger than this value cause a stack trace to be dumped
to stderr. The threshold for dumping stack traces is increased by a
factor of 1.125 every time we print a message so that the threshold
automatically goes up by a factor of ~1000 every 60 messages. This
bounds the amount of extra logging generated by this flag. Default
value of this flag is very large and therefore you should see no extra
logging unless the flag is overridden.

|`TCMALLOC_MAX_TOTAL_THREAD_CACHE_BYTES` |default: 33554432 |Bound
on the total amount of bytes allocated to thread caches. This bound is
not strict, so it is possible for the cache to go over this bound in
certain circumstances. This value defaults to 16MB. For applications
with many threads, this may not be a large enough cache, which can
affect performance. If you suspect your application is not scaling to
many threads due to lock contention in TCMalloc, you can try
increasing this value. This may improve performance, at a cost of
extra memory use by TCMalloc. See link:#Garbage_Collection[Garbage
Collection] for more details.

|`TCMALLOC_AGGRESSIVE_DECOMMIT` | default: false |Enables "aggressive
decommit mode", which makes all tcmalloc to return all free spans to
kernel. This reduces total phsycical memory usage at cost of some
performance (about 2% cpu hit in Chrome was measured at some point).

|`TCMALLOC_OVERRIDE_PAGESIZE` | default: getpagesize() | Sometimes we
run on systems with larger than anticipatesd hardware page
size. I.e. ARMs (and soon RISC-Vs) can run 64k pages mode. We detect
actual page size at run-time and adjust our span sizings to do memory
management syscalls with correct granularity. Larger pages generally
cause somewhat higher memory fragmentation, so we have this parameter
to be able measuring fragmentation impact of larger pages.

|`TCMALLOC_HEAP_LIMIT_MB` | default: No limit | Sets limit on total
size of page heap (in-use spans and "free but not returned"
spans). When tcmalloc hits this limit it tries to return some free
spans to kernel. And if that isn't enough to keep page heap size under
limit it OOMs. "abseil tcmalloc" has equivalent "hard limit".

|===

Advanced "tweaking" flags, that control more precisely how tcmalloc
tries to allocate memory from the kernel.

[cols=",,",]
|===

|`TCMALLOC_SKIP_MMAP` |default: false |If true, do not try to use
`+mmap+` to obtain memory from the kernel.

|`TCMALLOC_SKIP_SBRK` |default: false |If true, do not try to use
`+sbrk+` to obtain memory from the kernel.

|`TCMALLOC_MEMFS_MALLOC_PATH` |default: "" |If set, specify a path
where hugetlbfs or tmpfs is mounted. This may allow for speedier
allocations.

|`TCMALLOC_MEMFS_LIMIT_MB` |default: 0 |Limit total memfs allocation
size to specified number of MB. 0 means "no limit".

|`TCMALLOC_MEMFS_ABORT_ON_FAIL` |default: false |If true, abort()
whenever memfs_malloc fails to satisfy an allocation.

|`TCMALLOC_MEMFS_IGNORE_MMAP_FAIL` |default: false |If true, ignore
failures from mmap.

|`TCMALLOC_MEMFS_MAP_PRIVATE` |default: false |If true, use
MAP_PRIVATE when mapping via memfs, not MAP_SHARED.

|`TCMALLOC_MEMFS_DISABLE_FALLBACK` |default: false |If true, OOM on
failing to allocate from memfs instead of falling back to anonymous
memory (sbrk/mmap)

|===

== [#compiletime]#Modifying Behavior In Code#

The `+MallocExtension+` class, in `+malloc_extension.h+`, provides a few
knobs that you can tweak in your program, to affect tcmalloc's behavior.

=== Releasing Memory Back to the System

By default, tcmalloc will release no-longer-used memory back to the
kernel gradually, over time. The link:#runtime[tcmalloc_release_rate]
flag controls how quickly this happens. You can also force a release at
a given point in the progam execution like so:

....
   MallocExtension::instance()->ReleaseFreeMemory();
....

You can also call `+SetMemoryReleaseRate()+` to change the
`+tcmalloc_release_rate+` value at runtime, or `+GetMemoryReleaseRate+`
to see what the current release rate is.

=== Memory Introspection

There are several routines for getting a human-readable form of the
current memory usage:

....
   MallocExtension::instance()->GetStats(buffer, buffer_length);
   MallocExtension::instance()->GetHeapSample(&string);
   MallocExtension::instance()->GetHeapGrowthStacks(&string);
....

The last two create files in the same format as the heap-profiler, and
can be passed as data files to pprof. The first is human-readable and is
meant for debugging.

=== Generic Tcmalloc Status

TCMalloc has support for setting and retrieving arbitrary 'properties':

....
   MallocExtension::instance()->SetNumericProperty(property_name, value);
   MallocExtension::instance()->GetNumericProperty(property_name, &value);
....

It is possible for an application to set and get these properties, but
the most useful is when a library sets the properties so the application
can read them. Here are the properties TCMalloc defines; you can access
them with a call like
`MallocExtension::instance()->GetNumericProperty("generic.heap_size", &value);`:

[cols=",",]
|===

|`generic.current_allocated_bytes` |Number of bytes used by the
application. This will not typically match the memory use reported by
the OS, because it does not include TCMalloc overhead or memory
fragmentation.

|`generic.heap_size` |Bytes of system memory reserved by TCMalloc.

|`tcmalloc.pageheap_free_bytes` |Number of bytes in free, mapped pages
in page heap. These bytes can be used to fulfill allocation requests.
They always count towards virtual memory usage, and unless the
underlying memory is swapped out by the OS, they also count towards
physical memory usage.

|`tcmalloc.pageheap_unmapped_bytes` |Number of bytes in free, unmapped
pages in page heap. These are bytes that have been released back to the
OS, possibly by one of the MallocExtension "Release" calls. They can be
used to fulfill allocation requests, but typically incur a page fault.
They always count towards virtual memory usage, and depending on the OS,
typically do not count towards physical memory usage.

|`tcmalloc.slack_bytes` |Sum of pageheap_free_bytes and
pageheap_unmapped_bytes. Provided for backwards compatibility only. Do
not use.

|`tcmalloc.max_total_thread_cache_bytes` |A limit to how much memory
TCMalloc dedicates for small objects. Higher numbers trade off more
memory use for -- in some situations -- improved efficiency.

|`tcmalloc.current_total_thread_cache_bytes` |A measure of some of the
memory TCMalloc is using (for small objects).

|`tcmalloc.min_per_thread_cache_bytes` |A lower limit to how much
memory TCMalloc dedicates for small objects per thread. Note that this
property only shows effect if per-thread cache calculated using
tcmalloc.max_total_thread_cache_bytes ended up being less than
tcmalloc.min_per_thread_cache_bytes.

|===

=== [#caveats]#Caveats#

TCMalloc may be somewhat more memory hungry than other mallocs, (but
tends not to have the huge blowups that can happen with other mallocs).
In particular, at startup TCMalloc allocates approximately 240KB of
internal memory.

Don't try to load TCMalloc into a running binary (e.g., using JNI in
Java programs). The binary will have allocated some objects using the
system malloc, and may try to pass them to TCMalloc for deallocation.
TCMalloc will not be able to handle such objects.
